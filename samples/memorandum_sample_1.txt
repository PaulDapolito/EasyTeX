        content:
            After a recording session with a pop singer, we were tasked with cleaning-up the corrupted audio track "popson
            g.wav". As far as we understood, this audio track was recorded in our music studio for the pop singer. Upon
            playing the sample after the recording session, we heard no audible song but significant high-frequency noise.
            Unfortunately, it appeared that interference was injected into the recording. We thus set out to clean up the
            sound recording using a non-causal filter in MATLAB and model a causal RC filter.
