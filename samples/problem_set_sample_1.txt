    problem:
        label: 1

        statement:
            What is the rate of change $f'$ of a function $f$ at the point $a$?

        solution:
            Suppose we have the model $M$ consisting of the set $A = \{\textrm{domestic cat, feline, mammal}\}$. Then, the
            interpretation of ${\sim}$ is to be "is a". From this, we see that the first axiom $A0$ is satisfied, for
            every domestic cat is a domestic cat, every feline is a feline, and every mammal is a mammal. Furthermore, we
            see that the third axiom $A 2$ is satisfied, for if every domestic cat is a feline, and if every feline is a
            mammal, then every domestic cat is a mammal. However, the axiom $A1$ does not hold, for it is not true that if
            every domestic cat is a feline, then every feline is a domestic cat. Thus, we have found a model that
            satisfies axioms $A0$ and $A2$, but not axiom $A1$.
