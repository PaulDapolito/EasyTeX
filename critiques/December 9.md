# Critique for December 9: Mauricio

## General Feedback

To start off, congratulations on getting so much progress done on your DSL. It is pretty incredible how much you've accomplished already. I think all the documentation and examples are great, and that you've done a really great job thoroughly testing your language. Honestly very little I can think of that would be improved from here on out other than simply working on adding more functionality to your language. 


## Questions From Paul

**What do you think about an environment for typesetting documents using EasyTeX?**

I think that would be really great. I can honestly see people using EasyTex someday so a an environment for typesetting documents in EasyTex is a reasonable goal, though I don't think it should be the focus for the last week of the project. 

**What would be an ideal editing environment for the language? Should this environment simply provide syntax highlighting, or should real-time feedback by way of automated compilation be incorporated into the language's environment?**

My favorite editing environment for latex is [ShareLaTex](https://www.sharelatex.com/). I know this is a fairly sophisticated development environment overall, but I think it'd be really cool to get some ideas from there. Some of the functionalities that it provides are syntax highlighting, real time feedback and auto compilation with a display for what the document looks like. There are several other features as well. While I don't think they're all necessary for your environment, seeing how they set it up could be good. 

**As per my recent changes in EasyTeX's installation and build processes, I am wondering if you have any trouble installing and running the language against the sample documents.**

Unfortunately I wasn't able to get everything installed on windows....however this might have something to do with how my specific machine is set up. I am going to try again on Wednesday and hopefully we can both work and see if we can get it set up. From reading your README i think the instructions are very clear.  

**Do you think that there are any changes I should make to EasyTeX's command-line output? Currently, the language specifies only the start and end of computation for successful execution, and I am wondering if I should incorporate anything else into the language's command-line output.**

I think that there isn't much more that I would recommend adding to this. I haven't been able to see what the computation looks like or how long it takes, but if it takes a long time for it to complete, maybe a status indication on what is happening would be nice. However not necessary. 

**I spent a fair amount of time adding documentation to EasyTeX this week. Specifically, I updated the project's README and grammar, as well as created documents describing the format of EasyTeX problem sets and memorandums. I also improved the project's selection of sample documents. Are these documents helpful? Is there anything I should add, or anything that should be removed? Did you find that any documentation was missing in trying to install/run the language?**

I think the documentation is fantastic. All of it looks very clean, the examples do the job of showing me what a project would look like and I feel like I would be able to make my own EasyTex document fairly easily. Other than adding more examples (which isn't very necessary) I'd say what you have is great! 



**From a higher-level perspective, what do you think is the most important aspect of the project to focus on in the final week?**

I think you have great documentation and well thought out and thorough tests. I would recommend maybe spending the rest of the week simply adding more to your language functionality and maybe even trying to find a way to get people interested in helping add to the language. Once again, great work so far!
