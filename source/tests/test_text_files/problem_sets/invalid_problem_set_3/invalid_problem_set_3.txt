    problem:
        label: 1

        statement:
            What is the rate of change $f'$ of a function $f$ at the point $a$?
            
        solution:
            Suppose $L_1$ is some arbitrary language over an alphabet $\Sigma$ with words $l_1,l_2,l_3,...,l_{n-1},l_{n}$. $L_1$ is defined as:
                $$ L_1 = \{l_1, l_2, l_3,...,l_{n-1}, l_{n}\} $$

            For the languages $L_1$ and $L_2$, we are given that that $L_1 \subseteq L_2*$. Using the fact that $L_1 \subseteq L_2*$ and the definition of the Kleene star operation, $L_2*$ must be such that:
                $$ \{\epsilon, l_1, l_2, l_3,...,l_{n-1}, l_{n},...\} \subseteq L_2* $$

            Using the definition of the Kleene star operation again, we know that $L_1*$ is given by:
                $$ L_1* =  \{\epsilon, l_1, l_2, l_3,...,l_{n-1}, l_{n},...\} $$

            Thus, Equation 1 becomes:
                $$ L_1* \subseteq L_2* $$

            And we have thus proven that if $L_1$ and $L_2$ are languages and $L_1 \subseteq L_2*$, then $L_1 * \subseteq L_2*$. QED.
