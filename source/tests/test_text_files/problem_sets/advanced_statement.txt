        statement:
            The perihelion and aphelion of asteroid \emph{Apollo} in its
            orbit around the Sun are \val{0.964 \times 10^8}{km} and \val{3.473 \times
            10^8}{km}, respectively.  Apollo therefore swings in and out past
            Earth's orbit.  Find (a ) the semimajor axis (b) the eccentricity (c)
            the period of Apollo's orbit in years.  Apollo is only one of many
            ``Apollo asteroids'' that cross Earth's orbit.  Some asteroids have
            struck Earth in the past, and others will strike in the future.
